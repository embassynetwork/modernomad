Hello!

Your event '{{ event.title }},' beginning {{event.start|date:"F j"}} at {{ event.start|time:"h A"}}, is now live! 

You can view or edit your event at https://{{domain}}{% url 'gather_view_event' location.slug event.id event.slug %}. 

This is a {% if event.private %}private{% else %}public{% endif %} event. Public events are open and visible to our extended community, whereas private events are visible only to people in the house (so they know what's going on) and to those with the link. 

Let us know any questions!
